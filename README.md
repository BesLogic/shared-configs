# Beslogic shared configurations

These are the base configurations shared across different Beslogic projects.

We recommend keeping the changes to the minimum needed (for example, avoid re-organizing entire sections) as to minimize the diff the next time you update your configs. It is generally recommended to check back on this page when updating workspace/editor/dev tooling settings.

## VSCode

Copy the [.vscode folder](/.vscode) into the root of your git project.\
If using a devcontainer or a code-workspace, copy its content in the appropriate sections instead.

Read the comments carefully, you will likely need to uncomment or modify a thing a two for your project. You can trim out configuration sections and extensions for languages your project doesn't use.

## EditorConfig

Copy the [.editorconfig skeleton file](/.editorconfig) into the root of your git project.

## dprint

Add the following into your `.dprint.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  // https://dprint.dev/config/#extending-a-different-configuration-file
  "extends": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BesLogic/shared-configs/main/.dprint.jsonc"
}
```

This configuration automatically includes known "exclusion" folders. But if you need to add more, you can copy and expand the `exludes` list in [.dprint.jsonc](/.dprint.jsonc).\
If you'd like to pin your config version, you can use a commit hash, like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BesLogic/shared-configs/a0d9a34/dprint.json`.

### package.json

#### (for dprint and ESLint)

To run dprint along with ESLint, add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "eslint": "eslint ./ --ignore-path .gitignore",
  "lint": "dprint check && npm run eslint",
  "lint:fix": "npm run eslint -- --fix && dprint fmt",
}
```

If your `package.json` isn't at root (like frontend/backend split monorepos), you can do the following to ensure the formatter (dprint) is run on _all_ files:

```json
"scripts": {
  "eslint": "eslint ./ --ignore-path .gitignore",
  "lint": "cd .. && dprint check && cd frontend && npm run eslint",
  "lint:fix": "npm run eslint -- --fix && cd .. && dprint fmt",
}
```

## TypeScript (tsconfig) and ESLint

See <https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-beslogic#base-tsconfigjson>

## Ruff

Copy the [ruff.toml skeleton file](/ruff.toml) into the root of your python project or root of your monorepo.\
(this may change if/when Ruff allows sharing external configs: <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/3363#discussioncomment-8911551> / <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12352>)

Consider adding `--diff` to your `ruff format --check` command.

## mypy

Copy the [mypy.ini](/mypy.ini) into the root of your python project.\
(this may change if/when mypy allows sharing external configs: <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/9620>)

You can remove sections that don't concern you (like pyright infered return types or specific plugins). Add any config specific to your project under `Specific to this project`.

## PR Autofixes

We've stopped attempting to support pre-commit.ci due to restrictions on downloaded bundle size and runtime downloads on the free tier. As well as having to individually duplicate and pin each ESLint plugin to an exact version. And finally, issues typescript-eslint project configuration and going Out Of Memory.

Instead, we can recommend:

- <https://autofix.ci/> (GitHub App, free for public repos)
- <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/add-commit> (GitHub Action, needs a custom PAT with `Contents` access to re-trigger workflows, cautious of infinite loops!)
- <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-auto-commit> (IDEM)
- <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Beslogic.apply-git-changes> (Private extension for Azure DevOps, we may publish one day)
